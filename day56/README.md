This notebook demonstrates a minimal end-to-end text classification pipeline using DistilBERT and PyTorch.
It covers tokenization, dataset creation with DataLoader, a simple fine-tuning loop, and inference with probability outputs.
Designed as a beginner-friendly example for understanding transformer fine-tuning in practice.
