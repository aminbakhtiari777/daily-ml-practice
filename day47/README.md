 Day X  NumPy, Pandas, Visualization & Machine Learning Practice
This notebook contains a structured set of 5 practical exercises covering core data science and machine learning concepts

Topics Covered
 NumPy statistics and feature engineering
 Pandas data manipulation and correlation analysis
 Data visualization using Matplotlib
 Linear Regression (R² evaluation and coefficient analysis)
 Logistic Regression (classification, confusion matrix, precision & recall)
 Objective
To strengthen practical understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, regression, and classification workflows using synthetic datasets.
This exercise simulates a mini end-to-end ML pipeline from raw data generation to model evaluation.
