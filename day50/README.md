Create a new feature (career_stage) and analyze salary growth using Pandas.

Compare LinearRegression and RandomForest for salary prediction (R², MAE).

Build an elite class and evaluate Logistic vs RandomForest (Precision, Recall, F1).

Design a simple MLP with ReLU (hidden) and Sigmoid (output); check overfitting.

Engineering insight: if nonlinear models perform better, the data is likely nonlinear.
