This Jupyter notebook builds and trains a Convolutional Autoencoder in TensorFlow/Keras on the MNIST dataset to learn compact image representations and reconstruct digits.
It preprocesses MNIST (normalization + channel dimension), defines an encoder/decoder CNN architecture, and trains the model end-to-end.
Run the notebook top-to-bottom to train the autoencoder and visualize reconstruction quality on test images.
