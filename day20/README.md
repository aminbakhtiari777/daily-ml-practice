This repository contains a set of daily exercises focused on building strong fundamentals in Python and Machine Learning.

The exercises cover:
1. Logical data generation and filtering using pure Python
2. Feature interaction and numerical analysis with NumPy
3. Data cleaning and feature engineering using Pandas
4. Data visualization and interpretation with Matplotlib
5. Supervised machine learning using Random Forest, including model evaluation and feature importance analysis

All tasks use synthetic data to strengthen understanding of data behavior, feature design, and model selection without relying on external datasets.
