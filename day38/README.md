NumPy: Generate a normal random array, compute mean/std vectorized, and standardize data.

Pandas: Create a synthetic dataset (age, income, education). Analyze top-income quartile and check for hidden bias in education.

Visualization: Scatter plot income vs education. Highlight older individuals and reason about misleading correlations.

Machine Learning: Define a rule-based target. Train Logistic Regression, evaluate with confusion matrix.

ML Thinking: Conceptual comparison of KNN vs Logistic Regression (data scale, noise sensitivity, decision boundaries).
