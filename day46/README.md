MNIST Data Augmentation Practice
This notebook works with the MNIST dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.
Images are normalized, reshaped, and augmented using ImageDataGenerator.
Rotation-based augmentation is applied to expand the training dataset.
The goal is to understand data augmentation and dataset preparation for CNNs.
