This notebook builds and trains a regularized CNN for MNIST digit classification using TensorFlow/Keras. It includes preprocessing (normalization, channel expansion, one-hot encoding) and a 2-block ConvNet with BatchNorm, L2 regularization, and Dropout for better generalization. The model is trained with Adam optimizer and uses EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint callbacks. Final performance is evaluated on the test set.
