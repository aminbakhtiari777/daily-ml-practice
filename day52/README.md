This notebook builds a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras on the MNIST dataset.
The images are normalized, reshaped with a channel dimension, and labels are one-hot encoded.
The model uses Conv2D and MaxPooling layers to extract features and classify handwritten digits.
Finally, the trained model is evaluated on the test set to measure accuracy.
